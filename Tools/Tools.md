## Core Tools

- Learn [[SQL]], the most widely used language for interacting with data.
- Learn [[Python]] which is the most popular programming language in data engineering. [[Java]] and [[Scala]] are also used for more niche use cases.
- Learn how to use a set of cloud tools like [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Microsoft Azure]], or [[Google Cloud Platform]]. Choose AWS if you're unsure because it has the most [marketshare](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/) and thus more job opportunities.
