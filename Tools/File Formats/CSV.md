A CSV file is a type of delimited text file that uses commas to separate values, with each line of the file being one data record. A record can have multiple fields, which are also separated by commas. Usually, a CSV files stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text form, meaning each line will include the same number of fields.

**Extension:** `.csv`
