[Rockset](https://rockset.com/) is a real-time analytics database designed to serve low latency, high concurrency analytical queries at scale. It builds a Converged Index™ on structured and semi-structured data from OLTP databases, streams and lakes in real-time and exposes a RESTful SQL interface.

## Rockset Advantages

- Data is automatically indexed in 3 ways (column, row, and search) as it is ingested
- Several built-in CDC connectors for RDBMS and NoSQL, stream, and event data sources
- No need for pre-built schema. Rockset automatically unwinds even nested data
- You can resize compute without having to stop or restart CDC streams
- Full-featured joins on streaming data
- Ingestion and queries can have seperate compute so you can scale for the two workloads independently
