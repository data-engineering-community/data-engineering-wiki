[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) is an open-source [[Relational Database Management System]] who's name comes from a combination of "My" the name of co-founder [Michael Widenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius "Michael Widenius")'s daughter, and "[[SQL]]". When Oracle acquired the company that owned MySQL, Widenius created a copy of it and built on it to create [[MariaDB]]. MySQL is a very popular database which today is commonly used in web applications.
