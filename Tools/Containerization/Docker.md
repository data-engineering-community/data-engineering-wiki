## Docker Advantages

- **Portability**: It can work on many different environments from local machine to cloud-based environment. This is crucial for cross-platform deployment.
- **Resource utilization**: **Docker containers** share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and efficient, leading to faster startup times, reduced storage usage, and lower operational costs.
- **Isolation**: Each Docker container is an independent unit, providing a level of security by separating itself from other containers. Hence, it reduces the risk of unintended interference or access.
- **Version and dependency control**: By the use of **Dockerfile** which is easy to modify to manage **Docker image** environment, the process of version control and maintaining reproducible environments is become easier for developers. 
## Docker Disadvantages

- **Security**: **Docker containers** share the host OS, meaning vulnerabilities at the OS level could affect multiple containers.
- **Management complexity**: **Docker containers** deployment requires knowledge and effort to manage and proper measure for scaling up.
- **Complex workflow**: Setting up Docker to run might be easy but making it work cooperatively with other components in the workflow is a hard challenge,
