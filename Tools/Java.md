[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine "Java virtual machine") (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
