# Overview

This guide is intended for people who are new to Data Engineering and aren't sure where to start. The purpose of this guide isn't to cover every single thing you need to know, but rather give you the working knowledge and the intuition to find answers later on in your Data Engineering journey.

## Step 1: Read the FAQ

![[FAQ#Frequently Asked Questions]]

## Step 2: Learn Data Engineering core concepts

- Understand the basics of a [[Data Pipeline]]
- [[Batch Data Processing]] vs [[Stream Data Processing]]
- [[Online Transaction Processing|Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)]] vs [[Online Analytical Processing| Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)]]
- [[Relational Database]] vs [[Non-relational Database]]
- [[Data Modeling]]: Similar to OLTP vs OLAP, read about [[Relational Modeling]] vs [[Dimensional Modeling]]

## Step 3: Learn the core tools
