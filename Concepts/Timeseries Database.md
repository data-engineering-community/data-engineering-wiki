A timeseries database (TSDB) is optimized to store, aggregate and analyze large amounts of continuously generated time-stamped data from sources such as IoT devices or sensors. They are used in applications that require monitoring performance changes over time or tracking sequences of events.

## Timeseries Database Advantages

- Generally provide built-in functions for analyzing timeseries data and lifecycle management
- More efficiently compresses and stores timeseries data vs general purpose databases

## Timeseries Database Disadvantages

- Not optimal for analyzing relationships between datasets
- Requires more storage because all timeseries data is indexed
- Require a greater amount of code and complexity vs general purpose databases

## Timeseries Database Use Cases

- Stock market data
- Trading platform
- Stock exchange
- Real-time ad bidding

## Popular Timeseries Databases

- InfluxDB
- Kdb+
- Prometheus
- Graphite
- TimescaleDB
