A Data Pipeline is a term used to describe a workflow consisting of one or more tasks that ingest, move, and transform raw data from one or more sources to destination. Usually, the destination data is then used for analysis or other business functions. There are generally 2 types of data pipelines: [[Batch Data Processing|batch processing]] (most common) and [[Stream Data Processing|real-time processing]] pipelines.

## Data Pipeline Architecture

A data pipeline's architecture is made up of 4 main parts: a data source, business logic, a destination, and a scheduler. It can be as simple as a script running on your computer and automated with Cron or Windows task scheduler. A more complex example might be streaming event data, processing it, then powering dashboards or using it to train machine learning models.

The architecture you choose can vary wildly and there is no one size fits all. However, once you learn the basics of building data pipelines, you'll be able to better understand the tradeoffs between architecture decisions.

### Data Sources

Common data sources are application databases, APIs, or files from an SFTP server. If you are looking for data sources to practice with or analyze, many governments publish their datasets publically and you can find them by searching "[open data portal](http://googleitfor.me/?q=open+data+portal)."

### Business Logic

Business logic is a general term that encompasses the type of transformations that need to be applied to the data inside the data pipeline. It usually involves cleaning, filtering, and applying logic to the data that is specific to the business.

### Data Destination or Data Target

Typically, the target where you send your data is another database. Common data targets are databases or data storage areas that are made for analytics. For example, a [[Data Warehouse|data warehouse]] or [[Data Lake|data lake]].

### Scheduler or Orchestration Tool

For simple pipelines, Cron is one of the most commonly used tools to schedule a pipeline to run. You typically install it onto a server where you want your script to run and then use [cron syntax](https://crontab.guru/) to tell it when to run.

For more advanced data pipelines where there are multiple steps that depend on each other, an advanced scheduler called a workflow orchestrator is more appropriate. Popular workflow orchestrations tools are: [[Apache Airflow|Airflow]], Prefect, and Dagster.

## Data Pipeline Examples

If a business sold software as a service, a Data Engineer might create a data pipeline that runs on a daily basis which takes some of the data generated by the software application, combine it with some data the marketing department has and send the data to a dashboard. The dashboard could then be used to better understand how customers are using the software.
