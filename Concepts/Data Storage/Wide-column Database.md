A wide column database organises data into flexible columns that can be spread across multiple servers or database nodes. They are also known as **column family databases**. They store data in rows based on the primary key of each record. Data is organised into **column families**, i.e. groups of columns that share same attributes. This means we can still access column data without reading entire rows. Each row in a wide column database is uniquely identified by a row key.

While similar to the tabular format of [[Relational Database|relational databases]], the name and format of the column of a wide column database can be different across rows in the same table.

Some sources such as Google Cloud use the term "column-oriented database" and "wide-column database" [interchangeably](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-nosql?hl=en). However, other sources draw a distinction, i.e. a wide column database is not technically a [[Column-oriented Database|column-oriented database]]. The key difference for column-oriented databases is that we store data as columns separately on disk, while for wide column databases we store them as rows, but with data organised as column families.
