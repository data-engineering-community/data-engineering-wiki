A graph database is a type of [[Non-relational Database|NoSQL]] database that uses nodes, edges, and properties to store data about entities and the relationships between them. The main purpose of a graph database is to allow for efficiently traversing the network of nodes and edges, and for analyzing the relationships between entities.
