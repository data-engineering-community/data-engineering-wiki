A non-relational database is a database that does not use a tabular schema of rows and columns. Instead, it uses a storage model that is optimized for the specific type of data being stored. For example, data may be stored as a key/value pair, as JSON, or as a graph consisting of nodes and edges.

## Non-relational Database Advantages

- Easier to scale ([[Horizontal Scaling|horizontal scaling]])
- Better at simpler queries
- Flexible schema makes development faster

## Non-relational Database Disadvantages

- More difficult to query complex data with relationships
- Flexible schema can become a mess

## Types of Non-relational Databases

[[Key-Value Database]]
[[Document Database]]
[[Graph Database]]
[[In-Memory Database]]
[[Search-Engine Database]]
[[Timeseries Database]]
