Data Processing is the act of transforming raw data into meaningful, actionable information. It involves collecting, manipulating, filtering, sorting, and analyzing data to extract insights, support decision-making, and enable business operations. Data processing focuses on what happens to data after it has been ingested into your systems.

## Data Processing Components

### 1. Processing Systems

- [[Online Transaction Processing|OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)]]
- [[Online Analytical Processing|OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)]]
- [[Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing|HTAP (Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing)]]

### 2. Processing Execution Models

- [[Batch Data Processing|Batch Processing]]
- [[Stream Data Processing|Stream Processing]]
- [[Micro-batch Processing]]

### 3. [[Workflow Orchestration]]

Scheduling/workflow orchestration manages the coordination of processing jobs.

### 4. Processing Architectures
