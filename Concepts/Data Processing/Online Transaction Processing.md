The management of transactional data which occurs in the day-to-day operation of an organization. OLTP systems record the transactional data and support the querying of the data.

## Transactional Data

Transactional data is data that tracks the activities of an organization and are typically business transactions such as payments received from customers, payments made to vendors, orders made, etc. These transactional events typically contain a timestamp of when it occurred and some numeric values or references to other data.

## Online Transaction Processing Examples

- ATM machines and online banking applications
- Credit card payment processing (both online and in-store)
- Online bookings (ticketing, reservation systems, etc.)
- Record keeping (including health records, inventory control, production scheduling, claims processing, customer service ticketing, and many other applications)
