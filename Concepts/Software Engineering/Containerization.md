Containerization is a special form of **virtualization** that packages the software code with its operating system libraries and dependencies into a light-weight executable unit called a **Container**.

## Containerization Advantages

- **Portability**: By packaging the code, its dependencies and OS, it solves the problem of "But it works on my machine", allowing the containerized software to run uniformly and consistently on various platforms.
- **Efficiency**: The software running in the containerized environment utilizes the host machine's OS kernel. Hence, it comes with a smaller size and requires less time to start up.
- **Faster deployment**: An application running from a container can be deployed easily and rapidly scaled due to their portability and efficiency.
- **Security**: The usage of containerization reduces the risk of the application being negatively impacted by security threats or exploits.
- **Microservices architecture**: Enables the development of modular, independently deployable services by using **Container** as deployment method.
- **Automation workflow**: Containerization can be integrated with **CI/CD** workflows, collaborating with various tools to create an automatic and consistent pipeline for building, testing, and deploying applications.

## Containerization Disadvantages

- **OS kernel**: Containerization uses the OS kernel to operate so if there are any vulnerabilities in the kernel it can potentially lead to errors on the application.
- **More security concerns**: Containerization require many components to function such as **Container**, **Container Image**, services,... These could be targets for exploits and attacks.
- **Increase Complexity**: The process of creating and managing **Container** is a thorny task that require deep and wide system knowledge.
- **Compatibility**: Containerized applications may face compatibility issues when interacting with legacy systems.
- **Steep learning curve**: Adopting Containerization requires significant amount of time and effort to master and apply into real-world system.

## Container 

A container is a lightweight, portable unit that packages an application along with its dependencies and runs it in isolation using the host system's OS kernel. Containers ensure consistency across environments, making them ideal for scalable and reproducible deployments.

## Container Image

A container image is a read-only template used to create containers, containing all the necessary code, libraries, configurations, and dependencies. It serves as the blueprint for running containers and can be stored, shared, and versioned through container registries.

## Container Orchestration

Container orchestration refers to the automated management of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle management. Tools like Kubernetes help coordinate these containers across clusters, ensuring reliability and high availability in production environments.

## When to use Containerization

### Do's

- **Working with a Microservices architecture**: If you're working with microservices, containerization is a great fit. Containers allow you to deploy, scale, and manage each microservice independently making your application more scalable and resilient. 
- **DevOps workflow**: This combined with containerization delivers consistency and speed to the process of CI/CD, enables efficient development, testing, deployment pipelines.
- **Complex dependencies**: By encapsulating dependencies within a **Container**, this allow applications to run consistently regardless of infrastructure.

### Don'ts

- **Simple application**: Using containerization for simple apps is overkill, straight deployment might be better regarding management complexity and speed.
- **Legacy system adoption**: "If it works, leave it be", refactor a working legacy system to newer technology might contain potential risks and tradeoffs that need consideration.
- **Fear of missing out**: "Everyone is using containerization so we need to use it too", this a false understanding of containerization usage. It is true that it provides many benefits to the development and deployment process, but when deciding to use a technology, you need to consider many aspects of a bigger picture. Everything has a tradeoff and containerization is not doing everything by itself, it needs to cooperate with its surroundings.

## Containerization Tools

- [[Docker]]: A widely used platform for building, running, and managing containerized applications with a robust ecosystem and CLI support.
- [[Podman]]: A daemonless (serviceless) container engine that offers Docker-compatible commands while supporting rootless containers for enhanced security.
- [[Kubernetes]]: An open-source orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters.
- [[Skopeo]]: A command-line tool for managing container images, allowing you to inspect, copy, and sign images without needing to pull them locally.
- [[Buildah]]: A tool for building Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Docker images from scratch or using **Dockerfiles**, often integrated with Podman for complete container workflows.
