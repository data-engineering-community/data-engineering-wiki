Scoring:

- Give yourself 1 point for each "A" answer.
- Total your points and refer to the interpretation below:

Interpretation:

- 8-10 points: Congratulations! Your job responsibilities align with data engineering practices.
- 5-7 points: You have some aspects of data engineering in your role, but there might be room to explore more data engineering techniques.
- 0-4 points: Your current role may not involve significant data engineering responsibilities. Consider exploring opportunities to expand your data engineering skills and experience.

Please note that this quiz provides a general assessment and may not cover all aspects of data engineering. It is intended to give a high-level indication of alignment with data engineering practices.
